    <p>
      I call myself a sound artist and composer. After completing my BA in Sound Arts and Design at the London College of Communication in 2009 I have specialised in creating compositions for contemporary dance shows and am part of several works that tour internationally. I also work as a light and sound technician which led me to design lights for some shows.

      Having worked mainly with dance for some years now, I am keen to explore new contexts for my work and acquire new skills. I completed a masters in Information Experience Design at the Royal College of Art in 2015 where I began exploring installation, interactivity and generative art.

      My practice investigates how sound affects our perception of a given reality and the ways that people categorise their sonic environment. I am also interested in how listening spaces are constructed and the possible uses of these spaces. I constantly test and further these investigations through creating new experiences for a variety of audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
      My work regularly interrogates the listenerâ€™s comfort zone; for me, every composition invites an audience into a journey, a game, a new place to explore and enjoy.
